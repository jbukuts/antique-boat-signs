    <p>Hello, I’m John Bukuts, founder of <strong>AntiqueBoatSigns</strong>. This business started out as a gift for my brother for his lake house. We grew up on the lake and my family’s first boat was an old Chris Craft, so I thought the sign would be a great gift. The sign turned out so well, that soon this business started.</p>

    <p>My replica AntiqueBoatSigns.com boat transom signs bring the beauty of old boats into your home and gives you an opportunity to gift someone a beautiful personalized piece of art that will never be forgotten</p>
  
    <p>I get my love of boats and the water from my grandparents Venora and Ronaldo, who introduced our family to lake life and showed me how to take care of our old wood boat. To this day I still use the special polishing compound Gramp’s taught me how to mix so many years ago.</p>
  
    <p>The signs that I sell are hand cut, sanded, finished, polished and packaged one at a time, by me. It takes patience to make a replica AntiqueBoatSigns.com sign that shines just like the real thing. These signs are not mass produced and each one takes hours to craft, but the result is truly a beautiful replica art piece. Each sign measures 23.75 X 11.75 inches.</p>

    <p>I want everyone who sees your personalized AntiqueBoatSign.com sign to want one too. So I make sure every detail is of the highest quality and that you are truly getting a wonderful value and your money's worth with this purchase.</p>
